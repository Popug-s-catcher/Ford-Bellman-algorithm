The realization of Ford-Bellman algorithm with GUI

The program is fully written in Python, using PyQt for GUI, Matplotlib and NetworkX for drawing the graph and more.

The description of Ford-Bellman's algorithm: https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%90%D0%BB%D0%B3%D0%BE%D1%80%D0%B8%D1%82%D0%BC_%D0%91%D0%B5%D0%BB%D0%BB%D0%BC%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%B0_%E2%80%94_%D0%A4%D0%BE%D1%80%D0%B4%D0%B0

To start the program run the main.py. All the instructions you can find by clicking the "help" button nearby "log" button at the right upper corner of the window. To test the program you can upload a graph from .txt file from /tests. There are several examples of usual graphs and graphs with negative cycle.
